# ðŸ“œ Infinite Image Scroller ðŸ“œ

Infinite scrolling is a way of loading content continuously with scrolling - thereby eliminating the need for pagination. 

Try out this example by scrolling down to see images loading infinately. Once the content reaches the end of the scrollable area a new random image is loaded from the Unsplash API. 

Click on the images to see the full size version in a new window.

This is mobile-friendly and fully responsive ðŸ’»

# ∞ Infinite Image Scroller ∞

Infinite scrolling is a way of loading content continuously with scrolling - thereby eliminating the need for pagination 📖  

Try out this example by scrolling down to see images loading infinitely. Once the content reaches the end of the scrollable area a new random image is loaded from the [Unsplash API](https://source.unsplash.com/)  

Click on the images to see the full size version in a new window 🖼️ 

This is mobile-friendly and fully responsive 💻

# Infinite Scrolling Images

Infinite scrolling is a way of loading content continuously with scrolling, thereby eliminating the need for pagination. 

Try out this example by scrolling down and see images infinately loading. Once the content reaches the end of the scrollable area another image is fetched and loaded using the Unsplash API. 

This is mobile-friendly and fully responsive.
